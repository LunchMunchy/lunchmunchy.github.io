# ‚ùÑÔ∏è I Flaked Out
It's true. I actually quit a 100 day challenge on the first day. \
But wait... It's not what you think! (Yes, I did clickbait you.)

You might have noticed I didn't blog or tweet 9/8/2022.\
You got me, I was busy that day. La-di-da. üôÑ \
But when I say "quit," I mean stop doing **[#100DaysOfKubernetes](https://100daysofkubernetes.io/overview.html)**. 

When I sat down to learn Kubernetes today, I came to a shocking conclusion. \
Kubernetes is just one constellation in the Milky Way of Product Delivery. \
It was then that I realized learning only K8 was an great way to limit myself.

This blog rant is my announcment to say I'm moving on to better things. \
I'm going to to learn the cloud. I'm going to do **[#100DaysOfCloud](https://twitter.com/100DaysCloud)**.

There's a lot for me to learn about everything.
- Containers
- CI/CD
- AWS/GCE/Azure
- Load Balancers
- Kernels

Yes, I know not all of those are cloud specific. But I think I can tie them in. \
Whereas K8 is a framework, Cloud is a general area of computing knowledge. \
But don't worry, I still intend to maintain a very large focus on Kubernetes.\
Switching challenge names just lets me enjoy a larger boundary of learning.

Never mind the fact it's what I studied in college, or that I'm working in the industry. \
I honnestly feel like a junior in all things CS/IT/Cyber. Damn you imposter syndrome.

I thought it would be best for me to document my growing knowledge base. \
I'm writing to a pretend audience as if they knew very little about my topics. \
After all, they say you learn the most when you teach stupid people: Like me.

Thank goodness I got that the weight is off my chest. \
Now I can finally get back to living up to my blog's subtitle. \
Also, I'm counting this as a makeup day for not blogging. Bite me.

# üí§ TL;DR
Doing **#100DaysOfCloud** now.
