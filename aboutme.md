subtitle: My insecurity is the punchline of my personality

Hi I'm Paul. I find amusement in writing to myself on the internet. My sense of humor is weird... I'm still trying to figure it out.

When I'm not feeling awkward, I like to entertain myself in other ways:

- Wearing an apron around the house
- Farming bacteria in gallon-sized jars
- Staring down small creatures in my backyard.

In spite of my oddities, my friends think I'm pretty cool. ðŸ˜³

### Why a blog?

I'm trying to make money. The way I see it, either some mid-cap company's hiring manager will offer me a job because they like my writing, or enough poor shmucks visit my site so that I can monetize their personal data with crappy ads. Trust me, it'll work out. **You'll see.**
